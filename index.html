                <p>Kevin is an excellent M&A attorney who helped my team and I navigate the sell side of a liquidity event for the company we had spent five years building in a rapidly evolving industry. He brought a thoughtful, thorough, and measured approach to crafting the transaction, always putting our interests first and continuously aligning our efforts to the North Star. His expertise is truly end-to-end, and any additional counsel he engaged for specialized work was excellent as well. I would work with Kevin again in a heartbeat.</p>
